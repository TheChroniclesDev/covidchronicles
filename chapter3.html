                The virus continues to spread heavily in Wuhan and throughout China. 
                Even with measures to contain it there is nothing that is stopping it now. 
                Wuhan falls and their hospitals are filled to the top with no climb even beginning to slow.
                
                <strong>As cases continue to keep climbing in Wuhan China calls in the army and forces their citizens inside. </strong>
                
                Nearing the end of the month tradegy strikes the United States on February 26th where the first death appears from coronavirus in the United States.
                Little to no time after this the President, Donald Trump, makes a statement at his rally that the coronavirus is a hoax by the democrats to kill off his campaign and he dismiesses the severity of the virus, despite warnings from doctors and scientists alike.

                During this time in the United States the campaign for the 2020 election rages on for anyone trying to defeat Donald Trump.
                In Iowa, where the democrats and communist party were having the Iowa Caucus, there was a disaster.
                They hired someone of the likes of an <em><strong>Arthur</strong></em> to code a mobile app for counting votes for the Caucus.
                The app falls apart and the democrats alongside the one commnist put themselves down entirely.
