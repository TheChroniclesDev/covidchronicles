                During this period there is a scare about World War 3 starting after Donald Trump orders a US airstrike that kills an Iran general. 
                The dude was a terrorist and honestly no loses here, but the twitter egirls and keyboard warriors seemed to think otherwise. 
                At this point in time Donald Trump is just the average president where lots hate him and lots like him and he is a chaotic neutral in the current period as it stands.
